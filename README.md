My 2 months of work, reverse enginnering x86 ASM with IDA and abusing the game and leaky antycheat. Have fun updating it :).
There are probably some leftovers from WPF drawing (currently it uses directx wrapper cause it's faster). Code needs cleaning.
Some functions are just rewritten assembler to C# so don't try to udnerstand why and how they work. They just work.
